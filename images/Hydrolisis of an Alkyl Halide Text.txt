Hydrolisis of an Alkyl Halide

Reactants - Primary Alkyl Halide, NaOH

Reaction Type - Sn2 Nucleophilic Substitution

How it Works
	1 - SN2 Reaction (Nucleophilic Attack/Loss of a Leaving Group): The electrons of the OH group attack the carbon bonded with the alkyl group. Since the alkyl group is a good leaving group, the halide leaves.
