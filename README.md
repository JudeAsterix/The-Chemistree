A Javascript canvas based reference tree of (mostly organic) chemistry mechanisms
## About
### What is this?
The Chemistree is a web application that resources an assortment of chemistry mechanisms currently found in Klein's Organic Chemistry. In it, each mechanism will be described, explained how the electron movement works and provide a diagram of the electron movement. Plus, each mechanism will be connected to one another in one big roap map diagram.
### Why is this?
Chemical synthesis is an essential part of chemistry, especially organic chemistry. However, little to no resources have the mechanisms for synthesis organized. At best, they're simply listed in a cumbersome list.
## How to Use
